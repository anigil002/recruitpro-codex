# RecruitPro Electron Feature Verification

This document summarises the evidence collected while reviewing the RecruitPro codebase. Each section maps to the feature list shared in the requirements and links to the primary backend or desktop components that make the feature work inside the Electron shell.

## 1. Core Project Management
- CRUD operations for projects and positions, lifecycle management, and bulk updates live in `app/routers/projects.py`.
- Project activity logging and dashboard summaries surface via `app/routers/activity.py`.

## 2. Intelligent Document Processing
- Document upload, multi-format handling, and project versioning are implemented in `app/routers/documents.py`.
- Automated AI analysis and market research triggering is handled by `app/services/ai.py`.

## 3. Candidate Management
- Candidate CRUD, duplicate detection, history tracking, and bulk operations are defined in `app/routers/candidates.py`.

## 4. AI-Powered Screening
- AI scoring, screening records, and activity logging live in `app/routers/ai.py` and `app/services/ai.py`.
- Deterministic Gemini helpers provide scoring and scripts in `app/services/gemini.py`.

## 5. Multi-Channel Sourcing
- Overview endpoints and LinkedIn/SmartRecruiters orchestration sit in `app/routers/sourcing.py` with queue workers in `app/services/ai.py` and `app/services/smartrecruiters.py`.

## 6. Interview Management
- Scheduling, updating, and feedback capture are implemented in `app/routers/interviews.py`.

## 7. AI-Powered Outreach
- Outreach email and call script generation are provided by `app/routers/ai.py` backed by `app/services/gemini.py` prompt packs.

## 8. Market Research & Salary Intelligence
- Salary benchmarks and market analysis endpoints are in `app/routers/ai.py` with Gemini templates in `app/services/gemini.py`.

## 9. Activity & Audit Tracking
- Activity feed retrieval and SSE streaming are defined in `app/routers/activity.py` and `app/services/activity.py`.

## 10. User Management & Authentication
- JWT authentication, password changes, and profile management are in `app/routers/auth.py` and `app/utils/security.py`.

## 11. Advanced AI Features
- Feature flags, prompt packs, embedding references, and admin management exist in `app/services/advanced_ai_features.py` and `app/routers/admin.py`.

## 12. Database Administration
- Admin database tooling and migration logging live in `app/routers/admin.py`.

## 13. Reporting & Analytics
- Dashboard analytics endpoints are provided by `app/routers/reporting.py`.

## 14. Desktop-Specific Features
- Electron main-process orchestration (backend spawning, tray, notifications, auto-update, storage, offline handling) is implemented across `desktop/src/main.js`, `desktop/src/backendSpawner.js`, `desktop/src/healthChecker.js`, `desktop/src/processMonitor.js`, and `desktop/src/restartManager.js`.

## 15. API & Integration
- REST endpoints for integrations, CORS, health, and versioning are covered by the routers in `app/routers` (notably `system.py`, `admin.py`, `sourcing.py`, `ai.py`).
- The OpenAPI schema is auto-generated by FastAPI in `app/main.py`.

## 16. Queue & Background Processing
- An in-process background queue with job tracking is implemented in `app/services/queue.py` and connected via `app/services/ai.py`.

## 17. Security Features
- Password hashing, JWT handling, IPC protections, and renderer sandboxing live in `app/utils/security.py` and Electron's preload/main scripts.

## 18. Configuration Management
- Environment-driven configuration (`app/config.py`) and feature toggles/integration storage (`app/services/integrations.py`, `app/services/advanced_ai_features.py`) power runtime customisation.

## 19. Search & Filter
- Candidate/project/activity filtering and summary endpoints rely on queryable SQLAlchemy filters across `app/routers`.

## 20. Data Import/Export
- SmartRecruiters bulk import lives in `app/services/smartrecruiters.py`, while bulk candidate export resides in `app/routers/candidates.py`.

## Desktop Validation Artifacts
- Automated tests (e.g., `tests/test_sourcing_overview.py`) assert end-to-end behaviour that the Electron shell consumes via IPC.

Run `pytest` to validate backend coverage before packaging the Electron build.
