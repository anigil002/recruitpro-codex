# RecruitPro Electron Feature Coverage

The Electron desktop shell currently focuses on a constrained subset of the RecruitPro ATS experience. The table below tracks how the renderer and bundled backend map to the capabilities enumerated in `../recruitpro_system_v2.5.md`.

| Capability Area | Status | Notes |
| --------------- | ------ | ----- |
| Core Project Management | ⚠️ Partial | Project list and detail views are available, but advanced lifecycle actions (multi-position orchestration, bulk updates, client insights) are pending. |
| Intelligent Document Processing | ❌ Missing | Document ingestion, AI extraction, and versioning flows are not wired into the Electron UI. |
| Candidate Management | ⚠️ Partial | Candidate list and profile stubs exist; duplicate detection and bulk ops are not exposed. |
| AI-Powered Screening | ❌ Missing | Screening configuration, scoring dashboards, and summary generation are not implemented in the desktop renderer. |
| Multi-Channel Sourcing | ⚠️ Partial | AI sourcing overview is shown, but LinkedIn, SmartRecruiters, and Boolean automation integrations are placeholders. |
| Interview Management | ❌ Missing | Interview scheduling and feedback flows are not surfaced. |
| AI-Powered Outreach | ❌ Missing | Outreach templates and sequencing UI are absent. |
| Market Research & Salary Intelligence | ❌ Missing | Market intelligence widgets have not been ported to the Electron view layer. |
| Activity & Audit Tracking | ⚠️ Partial | Activity feed component renders, but lacks advanced filtering and compliance export. |
| User Management & Authentication | ⚠️ Partial | JWT auth works; role management and admin tooling require additional views. |
| Advanced AI Features | ❌ Missing | Feature flags, prompt packs, and embedding browsers have not been built for desktop. |
| Database Administration | ❌ Missing | No UI for backup, restore, or migration oversight. |
| Reporting & Analytics | ❌ Missing | Dashboard shows summary KPIs only; full analytics suite is absent. |
| Desktop-Specific Features | ⚠️ Partial | Native shell boots backend and renderer; auto-update is disabled without external feed configuration. |
| API & Integration | ⚠️ Partial | Core REST endpoints used; broader API catalog remains unused in the renderer. |
| Queue & Background Processing | ❌ Missing | Job queue management screens are not yet created. |
| Security Features | ⚠️ Partial | Secure IPC and context isolation enabled; fine-grained security workflows not presented. |
| Configuration Management | ❌ Missing | Feature toggles and AI settings editors are not implemented. |
| Search & Filter | ⚠️ Partial | Basic search endpoints leveraged; advanced filtering for documents and activities is outstanding. |
| Data Import/Export | ❌ Missing | UI does not expose bulk import/export operations. |

## Next Steps

To make the Electron application fully feature-complete, we should prioritize:

1. Reviewing the authoritative product specification in `../recruitpro_system_v2.5.md` alongside the backend routers under `app/` to inventory missing endpoints.
2. Expanding the renderer (`desktop/renderer/`) with dedicated views for each capability area, starting with document processing, outreach, and interview flows.
3. Enhancing the Electron main process (`desktop/src/main`) to support background tasks (queue monitoring, auto-update feeds) and secure inter-process communication for new modules.
4. Coordinating with design to ensure new views match the documented UX while remaining performant inside the desktop shell.

Tracking progress in this file will help contributors understand which high-level features still require implementation work.
