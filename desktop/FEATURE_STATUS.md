## Verification scope

Latest full validation cycle: **Production readiness pass – Electron v1.0.0 (April 2024)**

During this pass we confirmed:

- Auto-update checks, release notes, and rollback paths perform as expected across macOS, Windows, and Ubuntu builds.
- Queue/system diagnostics surface live process metrics and expose retry controls without requiring developer tooling.
- Candidate, project, admin, and analytics workflows remain in sync with the FastAPI backend, including real-time activity feeds.
- Offline-first behaviors (cached auth, stored documents, deferred sync) keep the UI responsive when the embedded API is unavailable.

Document new findings or regressions below so the matrix remains an authoritative source of truth for the desktop client.

## Next Steps

The Electron shell now ships the full RecruitPro desktop experience. Ongoing work should concentrate on telemetry, regression coverage, and incremental UX refinements rather than net-new feature delivery. Tracking adjustments in this file will help future contributors monitor quality improvements over time. When a capability requires retesting, append an entry under **Verification scope** with the date, version, and a short note describing the scenario that was exercised.
